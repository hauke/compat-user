compat-user
===========

The compat-user git tree keeps track of the scripts
used to generate new tarballs for release. You can use
this git tree if you want to make your own releases
on your own time, maybe with some small delta.

To use this you will need to clone the following trees:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mcgrof/compat-wireless-2.6.git
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mcgrof/compat.git
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git

Then clone this tree onto the home directory of an account you can set up
cronjobs. Your cron job will look something similar to this:

compat@repository3 ~ (git::master)$ crontab -l
# m h  dom mon dow   command
02 15 * * * $HOME/cron-compat | $HOME/skip-colors | mail -s "Compat-wireless release for $(date -I) is baked" foo@bar.com
